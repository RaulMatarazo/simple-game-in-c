# Guessing game in C

This is a simple guessing game in C that uses a library that randomizes numbers

## How to randomize a number

To randomize a number you are going to need a library called 
time.h. Looking for the first case of the code you will see:

## Example

```c
srand(time(NULL)); // this is an anotation to use the rand()
numRobo = rand()%4 + 1; // 0 - 4 but i put + 1, so it is 1 - 5
```


## Annotations

The harder part of the project was randomize the numbers. You will see repetitive algorithms in each case.
